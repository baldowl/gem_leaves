== 1.0.3 / 2008-01-08

* Adios, hoe! Moved to echoe.
* New output format: DOT diagram.

== 1.0.2 / 2007-12-03

* Now the pruning uses the exact match on the gem's short name (so, ignoring
  capistrano doesn't mask capistrano-ext too).

== 1.0.1 / 2007-12-01

* No leaves, no output.
* Corrected a huge bug in the configuration file loading function.
* Reformatted the options' descriptions.

== 1.0.0 / 2007-11-30
