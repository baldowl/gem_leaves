* Renamed Manifest.txt; one step closer to Echoe standard.
* Changed gem's name, for consistency's sake.
* Added the gemspec generated by Echoe.
* Tweaks to general doc.
* Changed a bit the way we talk to RubyGems, to avoid deprecation warnings
  with the new RubyGems 1.3.0.

== 1.0.3 / 2008-01-08

* Adios, hoe! Moved to echoe.
* New output format: DOT diagram.

== 1.0.2 / 2007-12-03

* Now the pruning uses the exact match on the gem's short name (so, ignoring
  capistrano doesn't mask capistrano-ext too).

== 1.0.1 / 2007-12-01

* No leaves, no output.
* Corrected a huge bug in the configuration file loading function.
* Reformatted the options' descriptions.
